- 📚 **Modern Book Card Component** — Total overhaul of the book card with 20px radius, soft shadows, and floating pill-shaped availability badges with `backdrop-filter` blur.
- 🎨 **Premium Site Footer** — Reimagined the footer with bold headings, vibrant gradient social links, and refined scannability.
